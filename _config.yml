  Hi! I’m Kai, an undergraduate mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

  <br><br>
  I’m mainly interested in AI/ML/DL, especially in terms of their applications to robotics and autonomous systems. Specific interests include robotic perception (computer vision), motion planning (reinforcement learning, search/planning algorithms), control, and SLAM. Other interests include embedded programming for robotics (TinyML, RTOS) and quantum computing (quantum ML).
  Currently working at the Vision and Image Processing Group (UWaterloo) on deep learning for robotic arms.
  Past work: AI-assisted medical imaging (COVID-19 Diagnosis)
