  Mechatronics Engineering @ UWaterloo.

  <br><br>
  I’m mainly interested in AI/ML/DL, especially in terms of their applications to robotics and autonomous systems. Specific interests include perception (computer vision), motion planning (RL, search/planning algorithms), control, and SLAM.
  Currently working at the Vision and Image Processing Group (UWaterloo) on deep learning for robotic arms.
  Past work: AI-assisted medical imaging (COVID-19 Diagnosis)
