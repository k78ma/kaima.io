### Work Experience

Deep Learning Intern <br>
*Vision and Image Processing Lab - University of Waterloo*
- Designing and implementing object detection models as part of [FLAIROP](ttps://flairop.com) to improve robot perception.
- Built adaptive ensemble models with PyTorch and OpenMMLab to improve precision for similar objects.
- Trained robotic arm simulations with reinforcement learning to grasp objects based on their position and pose.
- Reduced model size while maintaining performance to optimize inference on resource-constrained robots.
- Enhanced training pipeline by automating label generation for our award-winning [MetaGraspNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03963.pdf) synthetic dataset, and expanding annotations to include RLE segmentation, poses, and keypoints.

<br>

Machine Learning & Computer Vision Intern <br>
*National Research Council Canada*
- Developed high-performing models for AI-assisted chest radiography as part of the [COVID-Net](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/programs/covid-net-ai-assisted-diagnosis-prognosis-covid-19-infection) project. 
- Engineered modular framework with self-supervised learning and deep AUC maximization to combat limited data, class imbalances, and low trustworthiness, using TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
- Led project to study the visual explainability and performance of Vision Transformer model architectures.
- Improved model evaluation by building a robust pipeline for trust quantification, cross-validation, performance logging, and data visualization.
- Prepared and presented publications as lead author for conferences and journals.
