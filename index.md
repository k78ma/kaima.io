### Work Experience

Deep Learning Intern <br>
*Vision and Image Processing Lab - University of Waterloo*
- Designing and implementing object detection models as part of \href{https://flairop.com}{\color{NavyBlue}FLAIROP} to improve robot perception.
- Built adaptive ensemble models with PyTorch and OpenMMLab to improve precision for similar objects.
- Trained robotic arm simulations with reinforcement learning to grasp objects based on their position and pose.
- Reduced model size while maintaining performance to optimize inference on resource-constrained robots.
- Enhanced training pipeline by automating label generation for our award-winning \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03963.pdf}{\color{NavyBlue}MetaGraspNet} synthetic dataset, and expanding annotations to include RLE segmentation, poses, and keypoints.
